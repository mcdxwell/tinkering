# ProjectEuler.net: Special Pythagorean Triplet - Problem 9

In the past, I solved this problem with *Python3*, but I wanted to solve it using *Go*. Similar to my previous brute-force implementation, I found one in [**Go**](https://github.com/jmoiron/euler.go/blob/master/009.go).

To improve on what I found, I generated the Pythagorean triplets and checked each one to see if they satisfied the condition:
> a + b + c = 1000
